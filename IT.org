*** Storage system

**** Erasure coding
   - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasure_code
   - Described as three numbers
     - Width = number of final "slices" of each object
       - Width cannot be larger than the number of slicestores
       - Width must be a factor of the number of slicestores
       - Width determined by:
           - capacity
           - reliability
           - number of sites
           - Performance
           - overhead
   - Read Threshold
     - Defines the number of slices that must be read to get the object back 
   - Write threshold (only thing that can be changed after vault created)
     - Defines the number of slices that must be written to be a successfully written object.  This number will be between the read threshold and the width
     - Closer to width leads to better instantaneous reliability
     - Closer to read threshold leads to higher write availability

**** http load balancing
   - Need to do *redirects* and NOT proxies
   - client app must support 307 redirect (307 should follow a redirect on PUT, whereas 302 should not)


*** Manager
   - Manager has a robust API
     - These can be used for pulling information for uptime, etc., by client applications

*** API

**** Configuration
   - When configuring the accessors, need to configure the pool with a specific [[API type]].  That means that the accessors will serve only one flavor of API.
     - Cloud Storage Object API = s3 API
     - Simple Object Storage API = OLD cleversafe API (not recommended)
     - Openstack Object Storage = SWIFT API (not feature-complete)
   - CAN configure multiple accessors, eg., one set of accessors that speak s3 and one set that speak Swift


*** Authentication
  - key concept--"users" do not interact directly with the system.  Instead, think of the "users" interacting with a client that then interacts with the system.
  
*** Creating and deploying Vaults
   - By default S3 authenticaiton is not enabled
   - Recommended to use root certificate for a client to make connection to Cleversafe Secure API
   - User can have multiple access keys
   - / (forward slash) is a valid char in a file name to emulate folder structure with S3 browsing tools. There is no folder structure in Cleversafe vault
   - Manager API would let you delete non-empty vault, not from provisioning API
   
*** Client software and libraries
   - http://aws.amazon.com/code/Amazon-S3?browse=1
   - http://s3browser.com/
   - https://cyberduck.io/
   - http://www.expandrive.com/
   - https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse
   - LibCloud or Boto3 (you want to use the newer version if you can) for Python
   - JClouds for Java (https://jclouds.apache.org/)
   - https://github.com/cloudyr/aws.s3
   
*** Random notes
   - GPFS will include tiering (automatic and manual) to object storage


*** TASKS
**** TODO Create redirecting load balancer
**** TODO Look at configuration options
**** TODO Create ServiceNow ticket category for Cleversafe support
**** TODO Document clients that are s3 capable
