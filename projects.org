Myriem Boufraqech mailto:myriem.boufraqech@nih.gov asked to look at three sets
of variant calls representing:
- Tumor
- Tumor-derived Cell Line
- Blood

She is interested in whether the cell line represents tumor and wants to
use the prepared calls (available as single excel files per sample, Ion 
Torrent) to prove that the tumor and cell line are the same. I talked with
her about the likelihood that we would not be able to determine that
relationship from the limited data.
